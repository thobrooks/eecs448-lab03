    <p>
      Hi, my name is Zakary Overmann. I like skateboarding, Watching <i>Lost</i>, and chatting with my friends on<a href="https://myspace.com/"> myspace</a>. If you spoil anything related to <i>Lost</i> for me,
      <b>YOU WILL BE SORRY!</b>
      I love Lost so much. It is such a deep and impactful show, that really makes you think. As someone with such an old soul, I get it. Maybe you don't. Not everyone can be as elevated as me.
      My mom keeps telling me I need to get a job. She doesn't get that my poetry is going to emphathize with millions of lost souls, but she threatened to kick me out so now I'm at Circuit City.

      So now you might be asking yourself, "What does someone as brilliant as me want to do with their life?".
      Worry no longer. I shall tell you my master plan. I intend on becoming:

    <p class="blood">
      <b>TO STAR IN A PROFESSIONAL NU METAL BAND!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I know, don't get too excited, but I think I've got a good shot at it. I've been studying the greats such as Linkin Park,

      and Korn,

    <p>
      So I think I've got a good shot at this. My mom won't pay for guitar lessons though so I'm having to learn on my own.
      Anyway, I think I've said enough. I'm going to rule all of you one day, so let this be your first glimpse into my greatness!
