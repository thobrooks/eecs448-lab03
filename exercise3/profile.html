    <p> Hi, my name is Zakary Overmann. I like skateboarding, Watching <i>Lost</i>, and chatting with my friends on myspace. If you spoil anything related to <i>Lost</i> for me, <b>YOU WILL BE SORRY!</b> I love Lost so much. It is such a deep and impactful show, that really makes you think. As someone with such an old soul, I get it. Maybe you don't. Not everyone can be as elevated as me. My mom keeps telling me I need to get a job. She doesn't get that my poetry is going to emphathize with millions of lost souls, but she threatened to kick me out so now I'm at Circuit City.</p>
